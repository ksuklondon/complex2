# Complex

An example of implementation of the Complex standalone class.  
The solution consist of three projects:
* _ComplexLib_ - library containing `Complex` class,
* _ComplexUnitTest_ - unit test for `Complex` class,
* _ComplexApp_ - sample aplication that uses the `Complex` class.

A set of tasks to be solved independently.
Each subsequent task will contain the solution of the previous task and subsequent elements (attributes, methods, unit tests) to be implemented.
The tasks will be named Complex \<task sequence number\> e.g. Complex1, Complex2 ...

## Tasks to be performed:
- execute the commands marked with comments `// TODO .....` in the following places:
     - declaration of the `Complex` class (_Complex.h_ file),
     - a file with method definitions of the `Complex` class (_Complex.cpp_ file),
     - unit tests file (_ComplexUnikTest.cpp_ file),
     - sample application (_ComplexApp.cpp_ file);
- check that all unit tests run without errors;
- check the operation of the `Complex` class using a sample program (*ComplexApp* project).

If you find an error, use the debugger to find and correct it. The corrected source code should be placed in the repository.
